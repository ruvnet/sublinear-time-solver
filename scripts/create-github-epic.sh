echo "EPIC TITLE: Sublinear-Time Solver Implementation"
echo "============================================"
echo ""
echo "DESCRIPTION:"
echo "Implementation of a high-performance Rust + WASM sublinear-time solver for"
echo "asymmetric diagonally dominant linear systems with npm/npx CLI and Flow-Nexus"
echo "HTTP streaming integration."
echo ""
echo "IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:"

echo "✅ Phase P - Push Method Implementation (COMPLETE)"
echo "✅ Phase A - Advanced Hybrid Integration (COMPLETE)"
echo "✅ Phase R - WASM Release Pipeline (COMPLETE)"
echo "✅ Phase C - CLI & Cloud Integration (COMPLETE)"
echo ""
echo "TASKS COMPLETED:"
echo "1. ✅ Rust Core Library (4000+ lines)"
echo "2. ✅ Forward/Backward Push Algorithms (1995 lines)"
echo "3. ✅ Hybrid Random-Walk Solver (2448 lines)"
echo "4. ✅ WASM Bindings & JavaScript Interface"
