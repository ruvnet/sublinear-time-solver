# sublinear-time-solver
Rust + WASM sublinear-time solver for asymmetric diagonally dominant systems. Exposes Neumann series, push, and hybrid random-walk algorithms with npm/npx CLI and Flow-Nexus HTTP streaming for swarm cost propagation and verification.

Rust-Based Sublinear Solver for Asymmetric Diagonally Dominant Systems
Overview & Goals
This project aims to develop a modular Rust crate that can solve asymmetric diagonally dominant (ADD) linear systems in sublinear time. The solver will leverage recent theoretical advances (2024–2025) in approximating solutions to row/column diagonally dominant linear systems
arxiv.org
. Key design goals include:
Cross-Platform Deployment: The Rust crate will compile to WebAssembly (WASM) for use in browsers and Node.js. We will publish it as an npm package, making it easy to run via npx or import as a JS/TypeScript module.
Modular Architecture: The crate will be cleanly divided into modules for core algorithms, linear algebra utilities, WASM interfacing, and integration layers (CLI and HTTP). This ensures maintainability and clear separation of concerns.
Advanced Algorithms: Support multiple sublinear-time solving algorithms – Neumann series expansion, forward/backward push methods, and a hybrid random-walk estimator – as described in recent 2025 literature
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. These enable solving ADD systems efficiently by exploiting their structure.
Flow-Nexus Integration: Provide a streamable HTTP interface compatible with Flow-Nexus MCP endpoints for dynamic cost propagation, swarm routing, and graph-based verification loops. The solver will be accessible as a microservice that can continuously accept cost updates and stream out solution updates in real time.
Performance & Precision: Prioritize low latency and configurable accuracy. Expose runtime parameters for numerical precision (e.g. 32-bit vs 64-bit floats), convergence criteria (tolerances), and error bounds so users can balance speed vs. accuracy.
Algorithmic Foundation
Asymmetric Diagonally Dominant (ADD) Systems: We consider linear systems $Ax=b$ where $A$ is row or column diagonally dominant (each diagonal entry dominates its row or column sum). Such systems generalize Laplacian matrices to the asymmetric case
arxiv.org
. Recent research has shown these systems can be solved (or locally approximated) in sublinear time under certain well-conditioned assumptions
arxiv.org
. Our implementation will incorporate three complementary algorithmic techniques from the literature:
Neumann Series Expansion: We express the solution as a Neumann series, for example $(I - M)^{-1} = I + M + M^2 + \cdots$ for a suitably scaled matrix $M$
arxiv.org
. If $A$ is well-conditioned (small “maximum $\ell_1$-norm gap” in recent terms
arxiv.org
), the Neumann series for $A^{-1}$ converges. The solver will compute a truncated Neumann series as a baseline solution approximation, with truncation length chosen based on desired error bounds
arxiv.org
. This provides a fast initial estimate of $x$ by summing a limited number of powers of $(I - M)$.
Forward & Backward Push Methods: We implement local push algorithms inspired by PageRank-solving techniques. In forward push (sometimes called ForwardPush), we iteratively push residual error outwards from a source node through the graph represented by $A$’s rows
arxiv.org
. In backward push, we push contributions from target entries backward through incoming edges. Both are classic local exploration strategies for solving linear systems on graphs (e.g. computing random-walk probabilities)
arxiv.org
. Our framework will treat ForwardPush and BackwardPush as two sides of the same coin – in fact, they can be seen as applying the same algebraic operation to $A$ or $A^T$ respectively
arxiv.org
. These methods allow solving for a specific component or a localized portion of the solution very efficiently, which is useful for swarm routing scenarios where only certain entries of $x$ are needed at a time.
Hybrid Random-Walk Estimation: We also support a bidirectional hybrid algorithm that combines random-walk sampling with the push approach
arxiv.org
. In this method, we use random walks to sample solution components (capturing global effects stochastically) and local pushes to deterministically spread or gather those effects. This bidirectional strategy, as recent work shows, can accelerate convergence for problems like estimating effective resistances and PageRank in directed graphs
arxiv.org
. In practice, our solver’s hybrid mode will initiate random walks from multiple nodes (or RHS entries) to estimate contributions to the solution, while periodically performing forward/backward push steps to propagate and refine these estimates. This yields a fast, robust approximation method well-suited for large graphs and “swarm” computations.
Each algorithm will be implemented in its own module (see below), and a high-level API will allow choosing the method or a combination. The algorithms will also be able to run incrementally – reusing prior computation to update the solution when the input vector $b$ or certain $A$ entries change (crucial for dynamic cost propagation in Flow-Nexus). We will include verification routines (e.g. computing residual norms, or double-checking a few random solution entries via independent random walks) to support graph-based verification loops, ensuring the solver’s answer stays within error bounds on the fly.
System Architecture & Modules
The solution will be organized as a Rust workspace crate with well-defined modules/crate-features for each component. Below is the proposed module decomposition:
Core Algebra Modules:
matrix – Data structures for representing the linear system. Provides storage for matrix $A$ (sparse representation) and vectors, plus utilities for accessing rows/columns quickly. Will support both standard CSR/CSC formats and graph adjacency lists (for push algorithms).
solver::neumann – Implements the Neumann series solver. Exposes functions to compute a truncated series $I + M + M^2 + \dots + M^k$ times $b$ efficiently. Includes logic to choose $k$ (or convergence tolerance) and uses vectorized operations for summing series.
solver::forward_push – Implements the forward push algorithm. Includes methods to initialize a residual vector and iteratively distribute residual along outgoing edges of the graph. Will have an option to target either full-solution computation or single-index estimation.
solver::backward_push – Similar to forward_push but operates on $A^T$ (or incoming edges). Useful for computing influence of a given node on the solution.
solver::hybrid – Orchestrates the hybrid random-walk approach. This module will manage sampling (using randomness) and coordinate between push steps and random-walk steps. It may depend on submodules: e.g. random_walk for performing walk simulations (with routines to simulate one step of the Markov chain defined by $I - D^{-1}A$, etc.), and will use forward_push/backward_push internally.
verification – Provides routines to verify or refine solutions. For example, a function to compute the residual $r = b - Ax$ for a given approximate $x$, and check if all $|r_i|$ are below tolerance. Another function might perform a random probe: pick a random index and run a high-precision solver (or deep random-walk simulation) to double-check $x_i$. This module ensures confidence in solutions, enabling graph-based verification loops where the system can automatically correct any large errors.
WASM Interface Module:
wasm_iface – This module (compiled conditionally when targeting WASM) will expose a WebAssembly-bindings friendly interface. We will use wasm-bindgen to export high-level functions and structs to JavaScript. For example, we might expose a Solver class with methods like init(matrix: Matrix, b: Vector, opts: SolverOptions), solve(method: MethodType) -> SolutionStream, update_cost(delta: Update). The SolutionStream could be a JavaScript AsyncIterator or event emitter that yields partial solution updates if streaming is enabled. We will carefully design the interface so that large data (matrices, vectors) can be passed efficiently (possibly via shared memory or by passing pointers to WASM memory, depending on wasm-bindgen capabilities).
HTTP Adapter (Flow-Nexus Integration):
http_server – A small module (used only in Node.js contexts) to handle HTTP requests and feed them into the core solver. Rather than using a Rust HTTP library directly in WASM (which is not feasible in the browser and unnecessary in Node), we will likely implement the HTTP server in the Node wrapper side. However, this Rust module can define data models (e.g. JSON request/response schemas) and helper functions for streaming. For instance, it might define a struct UpdateRequest { delta_costs: Vec<(NodeId, f64)> } and a function apply_update(&mut Solver, req: UpdateRequest) -> PartialSolution. The Node layer will call these to get data to send back. The focus is enabling a streamable HTTP interface: when a client POSTs a stream of updates, the server should continuously respond with new solution deltas. We plan to use HTTP chunked transfer or Server-Sent Events to push a stream of JSON updates to the client as the solver iterates.
CLI & Binding Modules:
cli – Entry point for command-line use. We will use Rust’s structopt/clap or similar for argument parsing in a native build. This module will not be compiled to WASM (it can be behind a cargo feature flag). It will allow running the solver locally (for testing or non-WASM use) and potentially starting the HTTP server in a standalone mode (for self-hosting the service).
lib.rs – The main library file will tie everything together. It will conditionally include the wasm_iface for WASM targets and the cli main for binary targets. The library will re-export key types (Matrix, SolverOptions, etc.) so that the JavaScript side can use them easily via wasm-bindgen.
All modules will be documented and have well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation is important: e.g., the solver::... modules will likely implement a common trait (like SolverAlgorithm) with a method solve(&self, A: &Matrix, b: &Vector, opts: &SolverOptions) -> Solution. This allows plugging in different algorithms under a unified API. The crate will also include extensive tests for each module (unit tests in Rust) to ensure correctness and that error bounds are respected for known test cases.
Rust → WASM → JS Pipeline
To make our Rust code usable in JavaScript and Node, we leverage the standard Rust-to-WASM toolchain: wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack. The build pipeline is as follows:
WASM Build: We will add wasm-bindgen annotations to export the necessary Rust functions and structures. For example, we might have:
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub struct Solver { /* fields for matrix, factorization, etc. */ }

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl Solver {
    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    pub fn new(matrix: JsValue /* or custom Matrix type */, b: JsValue) -> Solver { ... }

    #[wasm_bindgen]
    pub fn solve(&mut self, method: String) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue> { ... }

    #[wasm_bindgen]
    pub fn stream_solve(&mut self, method: String) -> SolutionStream { ... }
}
We’ll ensure that data types crossing the boundary are WASM-friendly. For large matrices, one strategy is to accept a JavaScript Float64Array (for values) and Uint32Array (for indices) that reference the matrix in a compressed sparse form; the Rust code can wrap these without copying (using wasm-bindgen’s memory view). This avoids heavy data transfer overhead, crucial for minimal latency.
Packaging with wasm-pack: Using wasm-pack build, we compile the Rust crate into a WebAssembly binary and generate a companion JS wrapper. The wasm-pack tool will output a pkg/ directory containing my_solver_bg.wasm (the binary) and my_solver.js (the loader and JS interface code), along with TypeScript definitions and a package.json. This ready-to-publish package can be pushed to npm
rustwasm.github.io
. We will configure wasm-pack to target both bundler and Node.js environments. Specifically:
wasm-pack build --target bundler for a package that works with bundlers or in the browser (ES module output).
wasm-pack build --target nodejs for a Node-optimized package (CommonJS output for require()), ensuring the CLI can use it.
In our npm distribution, we can include both by publishing under one scope or using conditional exports in package.json (e.g. .node vs .browser fields).
JavaScript Interface: The JS wrapper (generated by wasm-pack) will provide functions corresponding to our wasm_bindgen exports. We’ll likely have an async initialization function (to load the WASM) that returns our Solver class. Usage in Node or browser will look like:
import init, { Solver } from '@myorg/add-solver';
await init();  // loads the WASM
const solver = new Solver(matrixData, rhsData);
solver.solve('hybrid');  // synchronous solve returning result (if quick)
// or stream solution:
for await (const update of solver.stream_solve('hybrid')) {
    console.log("Partial solution update:", update);
}
Under the hood, stream_solve could return an AsyncIterator that yields JSON objects or a custom JS class wrapping a stream. We might implement it by having Rust spawn a background thread (if WASM threads are enabled) or by chunking the computation and yielding between chunks via await. Another approach is to utilize JS callbacks: e.g., have the Rust code call a JS-provided callback function every iteration using wasm-bindgen’s callback support. The chosen method will ensure that partial results can propagate out without blocking the event loop for too long.
Memory and Performance: We choose f64 (double precision) as the default numeric type to maintain accuracy (critical for convergence in ill-conditioned systems), but we will allow a compile-time or runtime choice for f32 if needed for speed. The WASM build will enable optimizations like SIMD if available (wasm-pack in release mode enables many optimizations). We also consider using wee_alloc as the allocator for smaller WASM binary size. The goal is that the core solving runs at native speed within the WASM sandbox, and the overhead between Rust and JS is minimized by bulk data transfers and careful API design (no frequent small calls crossing the boundary during tight loops).
Overall, the Rust→WASM→JS pipeline ensures our solver can be embedded in any JS environment with ease. A web application could use it to compute solutions in-browser (taking advantage of WASM’s speed), and Node-based systems (like Flow-Nexus agent sandboxes) can import it for server-side solving. The npm package distribution simplifies installation – users can do npm install add-solver and get both the CLI and library.
HTTP Interface for Flow-Nexus
To integrate with Flow-Nexus, we implement a streamable HTTP API on top of the solver. The design caters to Flow-Nexus’s use of persistent, real-time data streams (as hinted by its MCP endpoints). Our HTTP interface will allow a client (likely a Flow-Nexus agent or workflow step) to open a connection, send a series of cost updates, and receive incremental solutions with minimal latency. Endpoint Design: We will expose at least one primary endpoint, for example:
POST /solve-stream – Opens a streaming solve session. The client posts a JSON body containing the initial system (matrix data or a reference to it, initial $b$ vector, and solver options like method and tolerance). The HTTP connection remains open, and the client can stream subsequent JSON messages in the request body to send updates (e.g. changes in the cost vector $b$ or modifications to some matrix entries). We will use newline-delimited JSON or a similar protocol for parsing streaming input. The server responds by streaming back a sequence of JSON objects in the response. Each response chunk could contain fields like "iteration": k, summary of the current solution or partial solution (for instance, "x_partial": [...] for some indices or "residual": ...), or an acknowledgement of an update. The streaming continues until the client terminates the session or a preset iteration limit is reached. This design enables persistent swarm cost updates: as new cost data arrives (perhaps from other agents in the swarm or changing network conditions), the solver assimilates them and emits updated solution info on the fly.
GET /solve?once (optional) – For simple usage, we may also allow a one-shot solve via a GET or POST that returns the final solution when done. This is mainly for completeness; the primary mode in Flow-Nexus will be the streaming POST for continuous updates.
Streaming Mechanics: We will implement the streaming using Node’s HTTP capabilities, since our WASM code cannot directly listen on a socket. Likely, the CLI (Node) wrapper will contain logic such as:
Use Node’s http or an Express server to handle requests.
On POST /solve-stream, initialize a Solver instance (via the WASM) with the given matrix and parameters. Then as data chunks arrive on the request, parse them as updates and call the solver’s update routine. After each update (or each solver iteration), retrieve the latest solution state or delta and write it to the response stream. Use response.flush() (with Transfer-Encoding: chunked) to send data immediately, achieving real-time streaming of output.
Ensure that multiple concurrent sessions are supported (each request gets its own Solver instance and thread of execution). Also enforce any Flow-Nexus auth or session tokens if required (the Flow-Nexus environment might handle that externally).
This adapter essentially bridges Flow-Nexus and our Rust solver. Flow-Nexus workflows can POST to our service as a custom tool for “cost propagation” tasks. For example, in a swarm routing scenario, each agent could report cost changes (e.g., congestion, load) to the solver service; the solver then streams back updated routing metrics or potentials that agents use to adjust their paths. Because the solver runs in sublinear time (and streaming updates are incremental), the latency for local updates is extremely low, satisfying real-time needs. Dynamic Cost Propagation & Swarm Integration: Our solver’s incremental update capability aligns with Flow-Nexus’s dynamic nature. We maintain solver state in memory between updates, avoiding full recomputation. If the matrix $A$ represents a network and $b$ represents external inputs/cost at nodes, a small change in $b$ will trigger a local recalculation (using, say, a few additional push steps or adjusting the Neumann series sum) and the new $x$ will be streamed out. This means costs are propagated through the network model immediately. The design supports swarm routing in that multiple solver instances could be running for different swarms or subnetworks, each receiving updates from its agents and sending back recommendations or verification metrics. Graph-Based Verification Loops: To ensure reliability in an autonomous swarm setting, the HTTP interface can provide verification data as part of the stream. For example, every N iterations or on request, the solver might include a "residual_norm": value or "verified: true/false" field in the JSON output. We can also offer a special endpoint or request flag for running a verification cycle – e.g., performing an extra random-walk sampling to cross-verify an element of $x$. This could be invoked periodically by a Flow-Nexus workflow to ensure the solution hasn’t drifted beyond acceptable error bounds. Because Flow-Nexus emphasizes robust, autonomous operation, these verification loops add confidence that the distributed decisions (based on the solver’s output) remain correct over time. Security & Robustness: The server will be stateless except for ongoing solve sessions. We’ll implement timeouts or iteration limits to prevent runaway computations. If integrated as an MCP tool within Flow-Nexus, we will follow their protocol (perhaps wrapping our API in an MCP request/response schema). The streaming is done over HTTPS (Flow-Nexus uses secure endpoints), and we ensure to flush data promptly to keep latency low. In practice, we aim for sub-millisecond computation per update for large graphs (given sublinear complexity and possibly WASM SIMD acceleration), and network overhead will be the main delay – which we minimize by keeping connections open and streaming rather than reconnecting frequently.
npm Package and CLI Usage
We package the project as @myorg/add-solver (placeholder name) on npm. The package includes:
WASM Binary & JS Glue: As produced by wasm-pack, including a bundler-friendly ES module and a Node.js CommonJS module. Users can import the solver in Node or web code. The package.json will have appropriate "main" and "module" fields for Node and bundlers respectively
rustwasm.github.io
. We also provide TypeScript type definitions (generated by wasm-pack) so developers get typed interfaces for Solver, SolverOptions, etc., out of the box.
CLI Script: We add a small NodeJS script in the package’s bin field (e.g. "add-solver": "bin/cli.js"). This script will load the WASM module and parse command-line arguments. Example CLI usage and syntax:
Solve a system from a file:
npx add-solver solve --matrix graph.json --vector b.csv --method forward_push --tol 1e-6
This would load the matrix (perhaps in a JSON or Matrix Market format) and vector, run the forward push solver with tolerance $10^{-6}$, and print the solution or relevant output.
Start the HTTP server:
npx add-solver serve --port 8080 --method hybrid --tol 1e-4
This launches the streaming HTTP service on port 8080, using the hybrid algorithm by default for any incoming solve requests (tolerance $10^{-4}$ unless overridden per request). The CLI will output logs about incoming connections and performance, helping in development or debugging integration with Flow-Nexus.
The CLI leverages our Rust code via the JS bindings. For instance, cli.js might do something like:
const { Solver } = require('@myorg/add-solver');  
if (cmd === 'solve') {  
    await initWasm();  
    let solver = new Solver(matrixData, vectorData);  
    let result = solver.solve(method);  
    console.log("Solution:", result);  
} else if (cmd === 'serve') {  
    startHttpServer(Solver, options);  // where startHttpServer sets up routes as discussed  
}
This way, the heavy lifting is still done in Rust/WASM, but the Node layer provides I/O and environment integration.
Build & Tooling: We will set up appropriate build scripts. For example, npm run build can invoke wasm-pack (with correct targets), and we might use a tool like wasm-pack-plugin for webpack if needed. We’ll ensure that publishing to npm is straightforward (possibly using wasm-pack publish which automates the packaging). Continuous integration will run cargo test for the Rust code and maybe basic integration tests for the JS interface.
Documentation: The npm README will include usage examples for both the library (embedding in code) and CLI. We’ll highlight the sublinear nature and recommended use cases (e.g. “Use hybrid for large directed graphs with up to 1e6 nodes for fastest convergence” or “forward_push is ideal when you only need a few entries of the solution”). We will also mention how to connect it with Flow-Nexus, perhaps referencing Flow-Nexus’s docs for integrating external HTTP services. If possible, we might provide a template Flow-Nexus workflow snippet that calls our solver’s endpoint to illustrate the integration.
By distributing via npm and providing an npx-friendly CLI, we make the solver accessible to a wide range of users without requiring a Rust toolchain. Developers can easily invoke it in Node or call it from web applications, and Flow-Nexus can pull it as a dependency or call the HTTP endpoints. The modular design and packaging ensure that whether it’s a one-off local solve or a long-running cloud service in a swarm, the same codebase serves both with minimal friction.
Phased Implementation Plan (SPARC Methodology)
To execute this project, we propose a phased plan that we dub SPARC – each phase focuses on a core aspect (Structure, Push algorithms, Advanced hybrid, WASM Release, CLI/Cloud integration). This phased approach ensures incremental progress with validation at each step:
Phase S – System Design & Scaffold: Set up the Rust crate with the basic structure and module scaffolding. Define data structures for matrices and vectors (sparse representation) and implement simple I/O parsers (for initial testing with small systems). Outline traits for solver algorithms (SolverAlgorithm) and create stub implementations. Outcome: A compiles-successful Rust crate with placeholder modules and a basic solve() pipeline. Even a trivial solver (like one iteration of Jacobi or using an existing linear algebra crate as a fallback) can be used here to test the wiring. Documentation of module interfaces is drafted.
Phase P – Push Method Implementation: Focus on the forward and backward push algorithms. In this phase, implement the core of solver::forward_push and solver::backward_push modules. Start with solving a simpler known problem (e.g., personalized PageRank on a directed graph as a test case, which the forward push algorithm should handle
arxiv.org
). Ensure that these algorithms can compute either a full solution or single-entry estimates depending on input flags. Write unit tests for push (e.g., compare forward push results to a direct solve on a small system). Outcome: Fully functional forward and backward local solvers, which already give the crate the ability to solve ADD systems approximately. Performance will be tuned for sparse matrices (using adjacency lists, avoiding redundant work by marking visited nodes, etc.). At this stage, we also implement basic Neumann series support in the solver::neumann module – likely by iteratively multiplying $M^k b$ for k=1...K until cutoff. This gives another method to cross-check results.
Phase A – Advanced Hybrid & Algorithm Integration: Build the hybrid random-walk solver and integrate all algorithms under a unified interface. The solver::hybrid implementation will combine random walk sampling with occasional push steps. We’ll base this on the literature’s recommendations for mixing time and sampling complexity
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. During this phase, we also refine the Solver API: create the Solver struct that can hold the matrix and any preprocessed data (like degrees or transition probabilities for random walks) and expose methods to select a solving method. Introduce the SolverOptions struct to encapsulate parameters (max iterations, tolerance, etc.). By end of Phase A, all three solving approaches (Neumann, push, hybrid) are implemented and can be chosen via a flag. We will test on medium-size random systems to ensure sublinear scaling (e.g., time grows slower than O(n) for well-conditioned cases, confirming the algorithms’ effectiveness). Outcome: A feature-complete Rust library for solving ADD systems, ready to be bound to external interfaces.
Phase R – Rust-to-WASM Release Pipeline: Now, focus on making our solution available outside Rust. Add wasm-bindgen annotations to the Solver struct and key functions. Set up wasm-pack configuration (in Cargo.toml, add cdylib crate type, etc.) and build the project to WASM. We’ll likely create a small JS test harness to verify that we can instantiate the WASM and solve a sample problem through the JS API. Also verify that the WASM binary size is reasonable (we may compile in release with LTO to reduce size). In this phase, we address any performance bottlenecks identified earlier – e.g., optimize hot loops in Rust, ensure that we don’t allocate too frequently (using preallocated buffers for residuals, etc.). We also ensure streaming support: if using async iterators or callbacks for partial results, implement that in the WASM interface now. Outcome: The pkg/ npm bundle is generated and tested. At this point, we can solve a linear system via Node.js by importing the package – a critical milestone towards integration.
Phase C – CLI, Cloud Integration & Final Polishing: The final phase focuses on user-facing integration and deployment:
Implement the Node CLI wrapper (cli.js). This includes argument parsing (possibly with a lightweight library or just manual since npx usage is often simple) and connecting to the WASM module. Test the CLI with various inputs.
Develop the HTTP server logic for streaming. We might write this in the cli.js (for example, if serve command is detected, we use an Express app within that script). Test the streaming behavior using a tool like curl or a custom client: send a sequence of JSON updates and ensure responses come in order with low latency. Fine-tune the flush intervals or chunk sizes if needed.
Integration with Flow-Nexus: If possible in a test environment, simulate a Flow-Nexus workflow calling the solver’s endpoint. This might involve ensuring our server can handle Flow-Nexus’s expectations for headers or authentication (from the docs, Flow-Nexus might pass an auth token or require a certain response format). We update documentation accordingly so users know how to connect it.
Add comprehensive documentation and examples (in README and Rust docs). Also, finalize configuration options: e.g., environment variables for debugging, the ability to output logs of each iteration if a verbose flag is set (useful when running in Flow-Nexus to trace what the solver is doing).
Lastly, perform rigorous testing: numeric accuracy on known benchmarks, fuzz testing for stability (random matrices), and stress tests for the streaming server (multiple concurrent connections, large streams). Ensure memory usage remains bounded and no leaks (important for a long-running service).
Once everything passes, publish the crate to crates.io (for Rust users) and the package to npm.
Each phase concludes with a review and possibly a demo: for instance, after Phase P we can demonstrate solving a small graph locally; after Phase R, demonstrate solving via a web page using the WASM; after Phase C, demonstrate a live integration with Flow-Nexus (if available). This iterative development with clear milestones (SPARC) will help manage complexity and ensure we meet all requirements: from the theoretical algorithmic performance to practical deployment in a cloud swarm environment.
Conclusion
By following this blueprint, we will deliver a robust, high-performance Rust-based system for solving ADD linear systems in sublinear time. The final product is not just a solver library, but a full-stack solution: a Rust crate with cutting-edge algorithms from 2025 research, seamlessly packaged into a WASM module and npm tool, and operable in complex distributed settings like Flow-Nexus. This design balances theoretical innovation (Neumann series and hybrid random-walk pushes 
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
) with pragmatic engineering (modular architecture, streaming APIs, and cross-platform support). The system will enable real-time, scalable linear system solutions for graph-based domains such as network routing, economic cost propagation, and beyond – aligning with Flow-Nexus’s vision of dynamic, autonomous agent swarms that can trust and verify their computations continuously.
