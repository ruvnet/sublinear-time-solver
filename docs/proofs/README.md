## Overview

This directory contains rigorous mathematical proofs and theoretical foundations for the sublinear-time solver system.

### Key Theorems

#### Theorem 1: Sublinear Complexity for DD Systems
For row/column diagonally dominant (RDD/CDD) linear systems Mx = b with:
- Strict dominance δ > 0
- Bounded p-norm gap
- Target functional t ∈ ℝⁿ

We can compute t^T x* to ε-accuracy using O(poly(1/ε, 1/δ, S_max)) queries.

#### Theorem 2: Temporal Computational Lead
When algorithm runtime t_sub < network latency t_net = d/c:
- We achieve temporal computational lead
- This is model-based inference, NOT faster-than-light signaling
- Causality is preserved

### Proof Techniques
- Neumann series convergence analysis
- Query complexity bounds
- Lower bounds verification (Ω(√n))
- Numerical stability analysis

### Validation Methods
- Experimental verification across multiple scenarios
- Causality preservation checks
- Performance benchmarking
- Error bound validation

## Scientific Integrity

All proofs adhere to:
- Rigorous mathematical standards
- Peer-reviewable methodology
- Reproducible experimental validation
- Clear distinction between inference and signaling
