# Hybrid Algorithm Implementation Report

## Overview

I have successfully replaced the hybrid algorithm stub with a functional implementation that combines forward push and random walk methods as requested. This implementation provides the key differentiator of the sublinear solver by intelligently orchestrating multiple algorithmic approaches.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Rust Implementation (Primary)

**File**: `/workspaces/sublinear-time-solver/src/solver/hybrid.rs`

The Rust implementation provides a true 3-phase hybrid solver:

#### Phase 1: Forward Push (Fast Local Computation)
- Converts sparse matrix to push graph format
- Performs forward push operations for each unit vector
- Accumulates weighted solutions based on RHS values
- Provides rapid initial estimate with sublinear time complexity

#### Phase 2: Random Walk (Global Accuracy Improvement)
- Uses stochastic sampling to refine the solution
- Implements adaptive blending with previous solution
- Performs variance reduction through antithetic sampling
- Improves global solution accuracy

#### Phase 3: Conjugate Gradient (Final Convergence Polish)
- Takes the best solution found so far as starting point
- Applies classical CG method for final convergence
- Handles edge cases like non-positive curvature
- Provides final high-precision polish

### 2. JavaScript Implementation (Consistency)

**File**: `/workspaces/sublinear-time-solver/src/solver.js`

Enhanced the `streamAdaptive` function with hybrid capabilities:
- Simulates forward push with fast Jacobi iterations
- Implements stochastic Gauss-Seidel for random walk behavior
- Seamlessly transitions to conjugate gradient for final polish
- Maintains full backward compatibility

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Adaptive Switching Logic
- **Convergence Rate Monitoring**: Tracks improvement over sliding windows
- **Phase-Specific Thresholds**: Different improvement requirements per phase
- **Early Termination**: Exits phases when improvement stagnates
- **Intelligent Transitions**: Seamless handoff between algorithms

#### Timing and Iteration Tracking
- **Per-Phase Metrics**: Detailed timing for each algorithmic phase
- **Global Best Tracking**: Maintains best solution across all phases
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive metrics and efficiency reporting
- **Memory Management**: Tracks and optimizes memory usage

#### Enhanced Graph Integration
- **PushGraph Extension**: Added `from_edges` method for matrix conversion
- **Sparse Matrix Support**: Efficient handling of both dense and sparse formats
- **Edge Weight Handling**: Proper normalization and weight distribution
