import { FlowNexusClient } from 'flow-nexus';

// Initialize components
const solver = await createSolver();
const nexus = new FlowNexusClient();

// Example: Fast portfolio optimization
async function optimizePortfolio(stocks, constraints) {
  // Build correlation matrix
  const correlationMatrix = await buildCorrelationMatrix(stocks);

  // Solve optimization problem in O(√n) time
  const optimalWeights = await solver.solve({
    matrix: correlationMatrix,
    vector: expectedReturns,
    method: 'random-walk',
    epsilon: 0.0001
  });

  // Deploy trading strategy via AI swarm
  await nexus.workflow_execute({
    workflow_id: 'portfolio-rebalance',
    input_data: { weights: optimalWeights }
  });

  return optimalWeights;
}
```
