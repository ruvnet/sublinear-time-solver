## Introduction

Social network analysis has traditionally relied on graph-theoretic algorithms that operate directly on network topology. However, many fundamental problems in social networks can be reformulated as linear algebraic operations, enabling the use of advanced numerical methods and sublinear algorithms.

### Why Linear Algebra for Social Networks?

1. **Centrality measures** can be expressed as eigenvalue problems or linear systems
2. **Influence propagation** models naturally involve matrix powers and geometric series
3. **Community detection** reduces to spectral clustering problems
4. **Opinion dynamics** are governed by linear equilibrium equations

### The Sublinear Advantage

Modern sublinear algorithms can solve linear systems in time proportional to the number of nonzero entries (often much less than O(n²)), making them particularly effective for sparse social networks.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Graph Representation

For a social network G = (V, E) with n nodes and m edges:
- **Adjacency Matrix A**: A_ij = 1 if (i,j) ∈ E, 0 otherwise
- **Degree Matrix D**: Diagonal matrix with D_ii = degree(i)
- **Laplacian Matrix L**: L = D - A
- **Transition Matrix P**: P = D^(-1)A (row-stochastic)

### Linear Algebraic Formulations

#### 1. PageRank Centrality

**Traditional Approach**: Power iteration
```
x^(k+1) = αPx^(k) + (1-α)/n · 1
```
Time: O(kn²) for k iterations

**Linear System Approach**: Solve directly
```
(I - αP^T)x = (1-α)/n · 1
```
Time: O(n^ω) where ω ≈ 2.373, or O(n log n) with sublinear solvers

#### 2. Katz Centrality

**Traditional Approach**: Matrix inversion
```
x = (I - αA)^(-1) · 1
```

**Sublinear Approach**: Linear system solving
```
(I - αA)x = β1
```
Using Neumann series approximation: x ≈ Σ(k=0 to K) (αA)^k · β1

#### 3. Influence Propagation

**Independent Cascade Model**: Monte Carlo simulation
**Linear Threshold Model**: Iterative activation

**Matrix Formulation**:
```
Total Influence = (I - αA^T)^(-1) · seed_vector
```

#### 4. Opinion Dynamics (Friedkin-Johnsen Model)

**Equilibrium Computation**:
```
(I - ΛW)x = (I - Λ)s
```
where Λ is susceptibility matrix, W is normalized adjacency, s is initial opinions.

    "adjacency": adjacency_matrix_sparse,
    "damping": 0.85,
    "epsilon": 1e-6,

    "vector": rhs_vector,
    "row": target_row,
    "column": target_col,
    "method": "random-walk"
