- **[The Speed Frontier: Why the Future of AI Runs in Microseconds](001-the-speed-frontier.md)** - *January 20, 2025*

  The next wave of AI is not bigger models, but faster loops. Discover how microsecond-scale computation is reshaping intelligence, enabling predictive interfaces, temporal-lead computation, and fluid robotic control. Includes quick start guide and practical production examples for high-frequency trading, robot navigation, and swarm coordination.

- **[Certificates of Confidence: How Mathematical Guarantees Enable Real-Time Decision Making](002-certificates-of-confidence.md)** - *January 20, 2025*

  From a 2 AM debugging session to mathematical certificates that quantify trust. Learn how modern solvers return not just answers but error bounds and confidence levels, enabling graduated response patterns in trading systems, robot control, and distributed computing. Features real-world case studies from Tesla FSD, Citadel Securities, and Google Borg.

- **Temporal-Lead Computing: Solving Problems Before Data Arrives** - *Coming Soon*

  A deep dive into how sublinear complexity enables computation to outpace the speed of light for global data transmission, and what this means for distributed systems. We will explore the physics, the mathematics, and the practical engineering of systems that complete calculations before their inputs fully arrive, opening new paradigms for global-scale computing.

- **The Architecture of Speed: Building Microsecond Intelligence Systems** - *Coming Soon*

  Practical patterns and architectures for leveraging sublinear solvers in production AI systems, from hierarchical time horizons to predictive memory systems. This post will provide blueprints for building systems that think faster than they can sense, with real-world examples from robotics, finance, and autonomous vehicles.

## About

This blog documents the development and applications of sublinear-time solving technology, focusing on practical implications for AI, robotics, finance, and distributed systems.

The core insight: when you can solve mathematical problems in logarithmic time instead of polynomial time, you unlock new categories of real-time intelligence.
