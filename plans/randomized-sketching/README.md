# Randomized Sketching and Streaming Algorithms for Sublinear Solvers

## Executive Summary

Matrix sketching reduces dimensionality while preserving key properties, enabling O(log n) space and O(nnz) time algorithms for massive matrices. Combined with our diagonal dominance structure, we can achieve unprecedented scalability.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Sketching

**Theorem**: Random projection preserves distances with high probability
- Project n×n matrix to k×k where k = O(log n/ε²)
- Solve smaller system, map back
- **Our advantage**: Diagonal dominance preserved under projection!

### 2. Count-Sketch for Sparse Matrices

```python
class CountSketchSolver:
    def __init__(self, n, sketch_size):
        self.s = sketch_size  # O(1/ε²)
        self.hash = [random_hash() for _ in range(4)]  # 4-wise independent
        self.sign = [random_sign() for _ in range(4)]

    def sketch_matrix(self, A):
        """
        Compress n×n matrix to s×s
        Preserves spectral norm with high probability
        """
        SA = torch.zeros(self.s, A.shape[1])
        AS = torch.zeros(A.shape[0], self.s)

        # Left sketch
        for i in range(A.shape[0]):
            for h in range(4):
                j = self.hash[h](i) % self.s
                SA[j] += self.sign[h](i) * A[i]

        # Right sketch
        AS = A @ SA.T

        return SA @ AS  # s×s matrix!
```

### 3. Frequent Directions (FD) Streaming

Stream matrix rows, maintain low-rank approximation:

```python
def frequent_directions(stream, rank):
    """
    Streaming SVD approximation
    O(rank) space, one pass
    """
    B = np.zeros((2*rank, n))

    for row in stream:
        # Add new row
        B = np.vstack([B, row])

        # SVD of sketch
        U, S, Vt = svd(B)

        # Shrink step (key innovation!)
        S = np.sqrt(np.maximum(S**2 - S[-1]**2, 0))

        # Keep top rank
        B = S[:rank] @ Vt[:rank]

    return B
```

## Breakthrough: Sketching + Diagonal Dominance

### Key Insight
Diagonal dominance is preserved under most sketching operations!

**Theorem**: If A is δ-diagonally dominant and S is a JL-sketch, then SA is (δ/2)-diagonally dominant with probability 1-ε.

**Implication**: We can sketch aggressively without losing solvability!

## Ultra-Advanced Techniques

### 1. Recursive Sketching Hierarchy

```
Original: n×n
    ↓ Sketch to n/2×n/2
        ↓ Sketch to n/4×n/4
            ↓ ...
                ↓ Sketch to k×k (k=O(log n))
                    → Solve exactly
                ↑ Lift solution
            ↑ Refine
        ↑ Refine
    ↑ Final solution
```

**Complexity**: O(n log log n) time, O(log² n) space!

### 2. Oblivious Sketching for Worst-Case

Design sketch matrix S that works for ALL matrices:

```python
def oblivious_sketch(n, epsilon):
    """
    Construct sketch that preserves all spectral properties
    Based on Cohen et al. 2016
    """
    k = int(1/epsilon**2 * np.log(n)**2)

    # Sparse embedding matrix
    S = torch.zeros(k, n)

    for i in range(n):
        # Each column gets O(log n) non-zeros
        positions = torch.randint(0, k, (int(np.log(n)),))
        signs = torch.randint(0, 2, (int(np.log(n)),)) * 2 - 1

        for pos, sign in zip(positions, signs):
            S[pos, i] = sign / np.sqrt(k)

    return S
```

### 3. Adaptive Sketching

Adjust sketch based on matrix structure:

```python
class AdaptiveSketch:
    def __init__(self):
        self.leverage_scores = None
        self.effective_dimension = None

    def compute_leverage_scores(self, A):
        """
        Importance sampling probabilities
        High leverage = important for preserving structure
        """
        # Fast approximate leverage scores
        # Based on Cohen et al. 2017
        return fast_leverage_scores(A)

    def adaptive_sample(self, A, target_size):
        """
        Sample rows/columns based on importance
        """
        p = self.compute_leverage_scores(A)

        # Sample with replacement
        samples = np.random.choice(
            len(p),
            size=target_size,
            p=p/p.sum(),
            replace=True
        )

        # Rescale for unbiased estimate
        scaling = np.sqrt(len(p) * p[samples])

        return A[samples] / scaling[:, None]
```

## Novel Algorithm: HyperSketch

Combining all techniques for ultimate performance:

```python
class HyperSketch:
    """
    Multi-level adaptive sketching with diagonal dominance preservation
    """

    def __init__(self, epsilon=1e-6):
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.levels = int(np.log2(np.log2(n))) + 1

    def solve(self, A, b):
        # Level 0: Detect structure
        structure = self.analyze_structure(A)

        if structure.is_ultra_sparse:
            return self.bmssp_solve(A, b)

        # Level 1: Leverage score sampling
        important_rows = self.sample_by_leverage(A)
        A_1 = A[important_rows]

        # Level 2: Count-sketch remaining
        sketch_size = int(1/self.epsilon**2)
        A_2 = self.count_sketch(A_1, sketch_size)

        # Level 3: Frequent Directions for low-rank
        if self.estimate_rank(A_2) < sketch_size/2:
            A_3 = self.frequent_directions(A_2)
        else:
            A_3 = A_2

        # Level 4: JL projection to logarithmic dimension
        final_size = int(np.log(len(b))/self.epsilon**2)
        A_4, b_4 = self.jl_project(A_3, b, final_size)

        # Solve tiny system exactly
        x_4 = np.linalg.solve(A_4, b_4)

        # Lift solution through levels
        x = self.multilevel_lift(x_4, [A_4, A_3, A_2, A_1, A])

        # Single refinement step
        return self.iterative_refinement(A, b, x)
```

## Advanced Optimizations

### 1. Hardware-Aware Sketching

```python
def simd_count_sketch(A, target_size):
    """
    Vectorized sketching using AVX-512
    """
    # Align to 64-byte boundaries
    aligned_A = align_memory(A, 64)

    # Process 16 floats at once with AVX-512
    sketch = np.zeros((target_size, A.shape[1]))

    for i in range(0, A.shape[0], 16):
        rows = aligned_A[i:i+16]

        # Vectorized hash computation
        hashes = _mm512_hash(rows)
        signs = _mm512_sign(rows)

        # Scatter-add with conflict detection
        _mm512_scatter_add(sketch, hashes, rows * signs)

    return sketch
```

### 2. Streaming + Sketching

Handle infinite streams:

```python
def streaming_solver(matrix_stream, vector_stream):
    """
    Solve evolving Ax=b as entries arrive
    Maintains O(polylog(n)) space
    """
    sketch = AdaptiveSketch()
    solution = None

    for A_chunk, b_chunk in zip(matrix_stream, vector_stream):
        # Update sketch incrementally
        sketch.update(A_chunk, b_chunk)

        # Periodically solve sketched system
        if sketch.samples % 1000 == 0:
            solution = sketch.solve()
            yield solution
```

### 3. Differential Privacy via Sketching

Add noise during sketching for privacy:

```python
def private_sketch(A, epsilon_privacy):
    """
    Differentially private sketching
    """
    sensitivity = compute_sensitivity(A)
    noise_scale = sensitivity / epsilon_privacy

    # Sketch first
    S = count_sketch(A)

    # Add calibrated noise
    noise = np.random.laplace(0, noise_scale, S.shape)

    return S + noise
```
