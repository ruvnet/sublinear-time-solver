### 5.6 Cross-Swarm Coordination

**Memory Sharing Protocol**:
```javascript
// Shared memory structure
const swarmMemory = {
  phase: "current_sparc_phase",
  progress: {
    alpha: { completed: [], in_progress: [], blocked: [] },
    beta: { completed: [], in_progress: [], blocked: [] },
    gamma: { completed: [], in_progress: [], blocked: [] },
    delta: { completed: [], in_progress: [], blocked: [] },
    epsilon: { completed: [], in_progress: [], blocked: [] }
  },
  artifacts: {
    specifications: "link_to_spec_docs",
    implementations: "link_to_code_repos",
    tests: "link_to_test_results",
    benchmarks: "link_to_performance_data"
  }
};
```

**Synchronization Points**:
1. **Phase Transition Gates**: All swarms must complete current phase tasks before proceeding
2. **Quality Gates**: Verification swarm approval required for production deliverables
3. **Integration Points**: Cross-swarm validation at module boundaries
4. **Performance Gates**: Benchmarks must meet thresholds before advancing

## 6. Verification & Validation Strategy

### 6.1 Mathematical Correctness

**Algorithm Validation**:
- Comparison against ground truth for small synthetic systems
- Convergence analysis with theoretical bounds verification
- Numerical stability testing across condition number ranges
- Error bound validation for each approximation method

**Test Matrix**:
```
System Types:
├── Well-conditioned ADD (condition number < 10^3)
├── Moderately conditioned ADD (10^3 ≤ κ ≤ 10^6)
├── Ill-conditioned ADD (κ > 10^6)
├── Directed graph Laplacians
├── Social network influence matrices
└── Economic flow networks

Problem Sizes:
├── Small (n ≤ 1000) - exact verification possible
├── Medium (1000 < n ≤ 10^5) - statistical validation
├── Large (10^5 < n ≤ 10^6) - performance validation
└── Huge (n > 10^6) - scalability testing
```

### 6.2 Performance Benchmarks

**Complexity Validation**:
```rust
#[bench]
fn bench_sublinear_scaling(b: &mut Bencher) {
    let sizes = [1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000];
    for &n in &sizes {
        let (matrix, vector) = generate_well_conditioned_add(n);
        b.iter(|| {
            let solver = HybridSolver::new();
            solver.solve(&matrix, &vector, &default_options())
        });
    }
    // Assert time complexity is o(n)
}
```

**Target Performance Metrics**:
- **Latency**: <1ms per incremental update for 10^6 node systems
- **Throughput**: >1000 queries/second on modern hardware
- **Memory**: O(nnz + k log n) space complexity where nnz = non-zeros
- **Accuracy**: Relative error <1e-6 for well-conditioned systems

### 6.3 Integration Testing

**Cross-Platform Validation**:
- Node.js environments (v16, v18, v20)
- Browser environments (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Architecture targets (x86_64, aarch64, wasm32)

**Flow-Nexus Integration Tests**:
```javascript
describe('Flow-Nexus Integration', () => {
  test('real-time cost propagation', async () => {
    const swarm = await initializeSwarm();
    const solver = new SublinearSolver(swarmGraph);

    // Simulate dynamic cost updates
